        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I have been an artist all of my life, so it was natural for me to study art at <a href="https://www.uakron.edu">The University of Akron</a>. As a senior, I completed a work study in New York City at Franklin Furnace art gallery.</p>
        <p>After returning to Ohio, I worked for a number of advertising agencies as a freelancer and eventually landed a job as an illustrator for a local newspaper. While working for <a href="http://www.hkmdm.com">HKM Direct Market Communications</a>, a marketing company. I taught myself web design there where I built a web to digital print application. This experience with my love for art and design opened a door for me to return to The University of Akron as a web designer.</p>
        <p>I currently work for <a href="https://www.toolingu.com/">Tooling U-SME</a> as a Front End Web Developer</p>
        <p>I am married with two kids. I love my family and enjoy doing things with them and teaching them about the world of computers. My wife is the Executive Director at <a href="http://www.leadershipmedinacounty.com">Leadership Medina County</a>. Together we grow in knowledge and share our love for business, technolgy and working to better our world.</p>
        <p>I live in Lodi, Ohio,</p>
